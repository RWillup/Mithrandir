# 1.5 Fetching a URL

Introducing two new packages, `net/http` and `io/ioutil`.

The `http.Get` function makes an HTTP request and, if there is not error, returns the result in the response `struct resp`. The `Body` field of the `resp` contains the server response as a readable stream. Next, `ioutil.ReadAll` reads the entire response; the result is stored in `b`. The `Body` stream is closed to avoid leaking resources.
