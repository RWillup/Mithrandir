# 1.5 Fetching a URL

Go provides a collection of packages, grouped under net, that make it easy to send and receive information through the Internet, make low-level network connections, and set up servers, for which Go's concurrency features are particularly useful.

Here's a program to illustrate the minimum necessary to retrieve information over HTTP. It is a simple program that fetches the content of each specified URL and prints it as uninterpreted text. 

```go
// Mem Fetch is a simple HTTP service to practive Go's net package

package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "io/ioutil"
    "net/http"
    "os"
)

func main() {
    url := os.Args[1:][0]
    resp, _ := http.Get(url)
    b, _ := ioutil.ReadAll(resp.Body)
    resp.Body.Close()
    fmt.Printf("%s", b)
}

```

Introducing two new packages, `net/http` and `io/ioutil`.

The `http.Get` function makes an HTTP request and, if there is not error, returns the result in the response `struct resp`. The `Body` field of the `resp` contains the server response as a readable stream. Next, `ioutil.ReadAll` reads the entire response; the result is stored in `b`. The `Body` stream is closed to avoid leaking resources.
