# 1.4 Animated GIFs

The next program demonstrates basic usage of Go's standard image packages, which we'll use to create a sequence of bit-mapped images and then encode the sequence as a GIF animation. The images, called *Lissajous figures*, were a staple visual effect in sci-fi films of the 1960s. They are the parametric curves produces by harmonic oscillation in two dimensions, such as two sine waves fed into the *x* and *y* inputs of an oscilloscope. This is an example:

There are several new constructs in this code, including `const` declarations, struct types,and composite literals. This example also involves floating-point computations.
