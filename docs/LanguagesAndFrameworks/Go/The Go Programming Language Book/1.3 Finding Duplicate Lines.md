# 1.3 Finding Duplicate Lines

```go
// Dup prints the text of each line that appears more
// than once in the standard input, preceeded by its count.
package main

import (
	"bufio"
	"fmt"
	"os"
)

func main() {
	counts := make(map[string]int)
	input := bufio.NewScanner(os.Stdin)
	for input.Scan() {
		counts[input.Text()]++
	}
	// NOTE: ignoring potential errors from input.Err()
	for line, n := range counts {
		if n > 1 {
			fmt.Printf("%d\t%s\n", n, line)
		}
	}
}
```

A `map` holds a set of key/value pairs and provides constant-time operations to store, retrieve, or test for an item in the set. The key may be of any type whose values can be compared with `==`, strings being the most common example; the value may be of any type at all. The built in function `make` creates a new empty map; it has other uses too.
