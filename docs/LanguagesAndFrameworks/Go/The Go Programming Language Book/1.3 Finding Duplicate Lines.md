# 1.3 Finding Duplicate Lines

```go
// Dup prints the text of each line that appears more
// than once in the standard input, preceeded by its count.
package main

import (
	"bufio"
	"fmt"
	"os"
)

func main() {
	counts := make(map[string]int)
	input := bufio.NewScanner(os.Stdin)
	for input.Scan() {
		counts[input.Text()]++
	}
	// NOTE: ignoring potential errors from input.Err()
	for line, n := range counts {
		if n > 1 {
			fmt.Printf("%d\t%s\n", n, line)
		}
	}
}
```

A `map` holds a set of key/value pairs and provides constant-time operations to store, retrieve, or test for an item in the set. The key may be of any type whose values can be compared with `==`, strings being the most common example; the value may be of any type at all. The built in function `make` creates a new empty map; it has other uses too.

When a map does not contain a certain key and you try to access that key, Go will return the default value for that type. For example, if you have a map with `string` keys and `int` values, if you try to access a key that does not exist, like `test`, you will get `0`, which is the default value for integers.

```go
fmt.Println(myMap["test"])
// prints: 0
```

The order of map iteration is not specified, but in practice it is random, varying from one run to another. This design is intentional, since it prevents programs from relying on any particular ordering where none is guaranteed. 

The `bufio` package helps make input and output efficient and convenient. One of its most useful features is a type called `Scanner` that reads input and breaks it into lines or words; it's often the easiest way to process input that comes naturally in lines.

The program uses a short variable declaration to create a new variable `input` that refers to a `bufio.Scanner`:

```go
input := bufio.Scanner(os.Stdin)
```

The `Scanner` reads from the program's standard input. Each call to `input.Scan()` reads the next line and removes the new line character from the end; the result can be retrieved by calling `input.Text()`. The `Scan()` function returns true if there is a new line and false when there is no more input.
