## 20: Keep knowledge in plain text.

## 21: Use the power of Command Shells.

## 22: Use a single editor well.

Choose an editor, know it thoroughly, and use
it for all editing tasks.

Some editors use full-blown languages for 
customization and scripting. 
Emacs, for  example, uses Lisp. 
As one of the new languages you are going to 
learn this year,  learn the language your 
editor uses. 

For anything you find yourself 
doing  repeatedly, develop a set of macros 
(or equivalent) to handle it.
Do you know everything your editor is 
capable of doing? Try to stump your  
colleagues who use the same editor. 
Try to accomplish any given editing task in 
as  few keystrokes as possible.
