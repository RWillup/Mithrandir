# 1.2 Procedures and the Processes They Generate

After learning the elements of programming, such as primitive
arithmetic operations, combining operations, abstracting these
operations by defining them as compound procedure, one cannot
yet say that he knows how to program. At that stage, one
would still be lacking the knowledge of common patterns of
usage, which procedures are worth defining, the experience to
predict the consequences of making a move, like executing a
procedure.

**Rob's note: Therefore, understanding Big O notation is fundamental**

To become experts, we must learn to visualize the processes
generated by various types of procedures. Only after we have
developed such a skill can we learn to reliably construct
programs that exhibit the desired behavior.

A procedure is a pattern for the *local evolution* of a
computational process. It specifies how each stage of the
process is built upon the previous stage. We would like to be
able to make statements about the overall, or global,
behavior of a process whose local evolution has been
specified by a procedure. This is very difficult to do in
general, but we can at least try to describe some typical
patterns of process evolution.

Let's examine the "shapes" of processes generated by simple
procedures and also investigate the rates at which these
processes consume the important computational resources of
space and time.

## 1.2.1 Linear Recursion and Iteration

```scheme
(factorial 6)
(* 6 (factorial 5))
(* 6 (* 5 (factorial 4)))
(* 6 (* 5 (* 4 (factorial 3))))
(* 6 (* 5 (* 4 (* 3 (factorial 2)))))
(* 6 (* 5 (* 4 (* 3 (* 2 (factorial 1))))))
(* 6 (* 5 (* 4 (* 3 (* 2 1)))))
(* 6 (* 5 (* 4 (* 3 2 ))))
(* 6 (* 5 (* 4 6)))
(* 6 (* 5 24))
(* 6 120)
720
```

*A linear recursive process for computing 6!.*

We begin by considering the factorial function, defined by

```code
n! = n * (n - 1) * (n - 2) ... 3 . 2 . 1
```

There are many
