# Procedures and the Processes They Generate

After learning the elements of programming, such as primitive
arithmetic operations, combining operations, abstracting these
operations by defining them as compound procedure, one cannot
yet say that he knows how to program. At that stage, one
would still be lacking the knowledge of common patterns of
usage, which procedures are worth defining, the experience to
predict the consequences of making a move, like executing a
procedure.

To become experts, we must learn to visualize the processes
generated by various types of procedures. Only after we have
developed such a skill can we learn to reliably construct
programs that exhibit the desired behavior.

A procedure is a pattern is a pattern for the *local evolution*
of a computational process. It specifies how each stage of the
process is built upon the previous stage.
