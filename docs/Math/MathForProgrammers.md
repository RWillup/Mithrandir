## What is Discrete Math?

* Branch of Mathematics that deals with a discrete or finite set of elements, rather than a continuous or infinite set of elements.

A good example to understand Discrete Math is the `circle` example. A circle has an infinite number of points that are equidistant from a point in the center. A a program were to write all the points it would run forever. So this is where we use Discrete Math. We use approximation to be able to represent a circle.

## What is a set?

A set is a collection of distinct objects called elements or members. An element is essentially anything you want it to be, like numbers, letters, variables, other sets, etc. 

Sets are usually noted by capital letters. We say that a set contains elements.
